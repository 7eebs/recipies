        Step 3) In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter, granulated
        sugar, and brown sugar until creamy, about 2 minutes.

        Step 4) Add the vanilla and eggs. Gradually beat in the flour mixture.
        Stir in the chocolate chips.

        Step 5) If time permits, wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for
        at least 24 hours but no more than 72 hours.
      </li>

      <li>
        Step 5) Divide the dough into 3-tablespoon sized balls using a large
        cookie scoop and drop onto prepared baking sheets. Bake for 11-13
        minutes, or until golden brown. Cool for 5 minutes before removing to
        wire racks to cool completely.
