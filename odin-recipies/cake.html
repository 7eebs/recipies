        STEP 1). Combine dry ingredients. Sift flour, cocoa, baking powder and
        baking soda into a large bowl. Add both sugars and salt and whisk to
        blend well, pressing out any lumps of brown sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        STEP 2). Combine wet ingredients. Combine eggs, oil, sour cream and
        vanilla in a medium bowl and whisk to blend well.
      </li>
      <li>
        STEP 3). Mix wet and dry ingredients. Pour the wet ingredients into the
        bowl with the dry ingredients and mix with a whisk or an electric hand
        mixer on medium-low until blended. It will be thick and somewhat dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        STEP 4). Mix in hot coffee. Add the hot coffee gradually in two stages
        to minimize clumps forming and beat until evenly combined and the batter
        smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        STEP 5). Bake. Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans and bake
        for 30-33 minutes until cakes spring back when pressed gently and a
        toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Transfer pans to a
        wire rack and let cool for 15 minutes before inverting onto the rack to
        cool completely.
